# An Analysis of "Scorched Earth and Chemical Weapons Attacks in Darfur"

## Introduction

#### Brief Overview

This web map outlines specific instances of human rights violations that occurred during 2016 in the Jebel Marra region of Darfur, Sudan. Though the Sudanese government engaged in military action in the region to put down a rebellion, there have been numerious instances documented that shows that the government carried out attacks against the civilian population of Jebel Marra. This web map displays specific locations where these human rights violations occured, and shows visual evidence of villages that were burned and where chimcal attacks happened.

#### Goal of the project

The primary goal of this project is to show the public specific documentation of human rights violations and combine this docuntation into one platform. The website itself also gives specific details of the project's goals when the "About the Platform" button is clicked:

```"The goal of this collaboration and the platform itself is to render visible the developments and scale of ongoing human rights violations in a remote and inaccessible part of Sudan"```

Overall, the project is aimed to drive awareness of these attacks, the human rights violations that occured, and detail how some of these attacks occured with eye-witness accounts.

#### Major Functions

The platform has three major functions:

1) To give an overview of the attacks that occured by plotting the location of the Attacks
2) To visual display villages that were clearly damaged/destroyed as a result of an attack through before and after satallite imagery, as well as eye-witness testimony of the attacks
3) To display locations in which chemical weapons were used, as well as eye witness acounts of the chemical attacks, and photos of the injuries that occured as to provide evidence of the use of chemical weapons.

#### Web Elements

One of the primary elements used on this platform is a leaflet web map that is centered on the Jebel Mara region of Darfur. Depending on which button is pressed, the web map changes size to accomodate other elements on the screen. The map displays various markers of where the attacks occured, and most of the markers have a pop-up text box once clicked by the user.

The left most side of the page primarily consists drop down buttons, text boxes and other buttons. When a button is clicked, it displays further text to provide further context about the subject. For example, when the dropdown button "Burned Villages" is pressed, it displays a text box that outlines when these villages began getting attacked and how these villages were often burned in the process.
