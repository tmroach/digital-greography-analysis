# An Analysis of "Scorched Earth and Chemical Weapons Attacks in Darfur"

## Introduction

#### Brief Overview

This web map outlines specific instances of human rights violations that occurred during 2016 in the Jebel Marra region of Darfur, Sudan. Though the Sudanese government engaged in military action in the region to put down a rebellion, there have been numerious instances documented that shows that the government carried out attacks against the civilian population of Jebel Marra. This web map displays specific locations where these human rights violations occured, and shows visual evidence of villages that were burned and where chimcal attacks happened.

#### Goal of the project

The primary goal of this project is to show the public specific documentation of human rights violations and combine this docuntation into one platform. The website itself also gives specific details of the project's goals when the "About the Platform" button is clicked:

```"The goal of this collaboration and the platform itself is to render visible the developments and scale of ongoing human rights violations in a remote and inaccessible part of Sudan"```

Overall, the project is aimed to drive awareness of these attacks, the human rights violations that occured, and detail how some of these attacks occured with eye-witness accounts.

#### Major Functions

The platform has three major functions:

1) To give an overview of the attacks that occured by plotting the location of the Attacks
2) To visual display villages that were clearly damaged/destroyed as a result of an attack through before and after satallite imagery, as well as eye-witness testimony of the attacks
3) To display locations in which chemical weapons were used, as well as eye witness acounts of the chemical attacks, and photos of the injuries that occured as to provide evidence of the use of chemical weapons.

#### Web Elements

One of the primary elements used on this platform is a leaflet web map that is centered on the Jebel Mara region of Darfur. Depending on which button is pressed, the web map changes size to accomodate other elements on the screen. The map displays various markers of where the attacks occured, and most of the markers have a pop-up text box once clicked by the user.

The left most side of the page primarily consists drop down buttons, text boxes and other buttons. When a button is clicked, it displays further text to provide further context about the subject. For example, when the dropdown button "Burned Villages" is pressed, it displays a text box that outlines when these villages began getting attacked and how these villages were often burned in the process. There are also three other standard buttons that users can press to get additional information. This includes the bottom for "Link to the Report", "Take Action", and "About the Platform". Pressing "Link to the Report" will take the user to another site where they can download a report of the atrocities that occured, whereas "Take Action" and "About the Platform" will open up in-page text pop-ups that provide additional information about the project and how people can take action.

There are also icons on the bottom left of the screen that allow people to share the platform on either Twitter or Facebook.

#### Audience

The audience for this project appears to be members of the general public, potentially members of the various governments, and people who are looking to be educated about injustices throughout the world.

Since these attacks occured in highly dangerous and unstable regions of Sudan, it can be challenging to fully investigate the claims about the attacks. However, through the use of satallite imagery, it can be difficult to hide clear destruction. Before and after satallite images shown on this page help to provide evidence for the claims made, as getting additional documentation (photos of burned villages, bodies, residue of chemical weapons) is unfeasible to get since the area is so dangerous. It would be difficult to get a team of outsiders into the region without putting their lives at risk.

I think another important audience are people who want to make a greater contribution to hold people accountable for events such as this. When a user clicks the "Take Action" button, they are directed to sign up for the "Amnesty Decoders" project, which is a group of volunteers who helps Amnesty International do their research. Here is how Amnesty International describes the project:

```"Amnesty Decoders is an innovative platform for volunteers around the world to use their computers or phones to help our researchers sift through pictures information and documents"```

#### Authors and their affiliations

The primary authors of this project are Amnesty International and SITU Research.

Amnesty international is an orgranization that fights against human rights abuses across the world, and helps raise awareness of abuses, who was affected by them, and who caused them.

According to the platform page, SITU Research "is an interdisciplinary practice working in design, visualization and spatial analysis" (background information on SITU research can be found by clicking on the "About the Platform Button"). Based on the description given, it appears that SITU Research's main work on this project was to design the interactive platform, while Amnesty International gathered the data for the platform.

#### Data Collection Date

It is not clear specifically when the data was collected, though we can assume most of the data was collected at various points in 2016 since this is the date in which the report the platform was based on was published. Additionally, it looks as though Amnesty International collected data between January and September of 2016, potentially indicating that there could have been further attacks that occured outside this time window (source: pg. 4-5 of the Amnesty International report: https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr54/4877/2016/en/).

#### Data Sources

The data sources for this project appear to be individuals who witnessed the attacks first hand and were interviewed by Amnesty International. Additionally, satallite imagery was also a source for confirming the destruction of villages in the region, as the satallite images showed clear signs of burned areas and rubble where the villages were located.

Additionally, Amnesty International sought outside advice to help verify claims that chemical weapons were used. While it cannot be confirmed with complete confidence that chemical weapons were used (since this would require investigators to travel to the region to conduct their analysis), the experts they sought deemed that the pictures of injuries and symptoms of surviors "strongly suggest that chemical weapons agents were used in the attacks" (source: pg. 5 of the Amnesty International report: https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr54/4877/2016/en/).

## Systematic Architecture



## UI/UX Critique

While this project is somewhat reponsive in the sense that it can be resized to fit larger or smaller browser sizes, it is not completely responsive. In fact, it cannot work on modile devices at all. When I attempted to view the platform on my phone, I recieved a message that simply said "this platform, a collaboration between SITU Research and Amnesty International, is optimized for desktop viewing." Even though it might be optimized for desktop viewing, I think this might be a major turn off for many users, since many people use their phones as their primary means of browsing the internet. Amnesty International has limited opportunities to get users to become engaged in their platform, and many people who are unable to view it on their phone will likely forget to visit the platform on their computer.

## Pros and Cons of this project

#### Pros

- This project found ways to document and verify human rights violations without directly sending people into the dangerous region in which they occured.
- The evidence presented for the attacks was visual, which can easily show the damage that occured.In addition to high quality before and after satallite images, there are also many images taken by villagers that show the damage on the ground.
- While the photos of the chemical attacks might be grusome, the presence of them on the platform helps provide transparency over the claims since other experts outside of Amnesty International can review the evidence and offer their opinions.

#### Cons

- There does not appear to be any updates about the situation posted on the platform. Though this event occured in 2016, I am curious to know if any progress was made as a result of this platform. The way it is now, it seems like the platform was a one-off, so I'm not sure if the status of this issue. I think it would be good if they had a section within the platform where they detail any updates or any progress that has been made as a result of their advocacy efforts. While I applaud Amnesty International for documenting this issue, I'm not sure how much of a benefit the project will be if the findings were mentioned once but then never revisited.

## Further Critical Analysis

One notable thing that access to satallite imagery presents is an overwhealming sense of surveillance over the world. Dispite the fact that there could be something going on in a remote/desolate area of the world, someone in a far away location can witness what happened in that remote area. In many ways, I think this idea can be scary. Everything we do can be watched by prying eyes, and we don't really get a say in the matter. The satellites are thousands of miles away from us, and there's not always much we can do to shield ourselves from this surveillance. Even for individuals, people can log onto Google Maps or Google Earth and survey a quite a bit of some place. You want to know what your neighbors back yard looks like? Easy, just zoom in on their location and enable 3d buildings. You can get a pretty good sense of the location just from doing this. Is this always bad? No. But the issue is it can be difficult (or impossible) for people to opt out if they want to.

However, this surveillance also means that it can be easier to catch bad actors when attrocities are commited. As we've seen from the Amnesty International platform, satallite imagery provides evidence for things that would otherwise be difficult to prove. Better yet, the evidence is highly visual, which makes it easy for people of any background to see what has happened. Because of this, it is harder for human rights violators to deflect accusations, as the world is watching what they do. Even if they prevent people from accessing the locations in which they occur, they can still be caught. I think this is a very positive thing, and in this case I am glad that it is not so easy to shield against satallite imagery.
